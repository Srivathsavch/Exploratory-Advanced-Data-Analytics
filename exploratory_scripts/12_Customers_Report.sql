/*====================================================================
Customers Report
======================================================================
Purpose:
- The report consolidates key customer metrics and behaviours
Highlights:
1. Gather essential fields such as names, ages, transactional details
2. Segment customers into categories(VIP,Regular,New) and age groups
3. Aggregations:
	- total orders
	- total sales
	- total quantity purchased
	- total products
	- lifespan (in months)
4. Calculations:
	- recency(months since last order)
	- average order value
	- average monthly spend
